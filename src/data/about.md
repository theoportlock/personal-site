Hey there! My name is Theo Portlock and I am a Systems Biologist with a specialisation in metagenomics. My current work focusses on using interpretable machine learning methodologies to understand the human oral and gut microbiome. I believe that the zero-inflated sparsity of species abundance data from metagenomics shotgun sequencing adequately resembles the neural arrangement of axons in the brain and is an ideal test-case for the training of novel machine learning methodologies.

I am very interested in collaborating with people who are interested in pattern recognition of this sort and so please contact me if you are interested! (links are in the bottom left of the page)
